My respect to all
I had an Idea where it's based on hapinness of those people who are mostly sad. Some people usually say that wealth doesn't bring happines.
My vision of this Idea started a year ago, and I though some cool features.
It's divided on two roles the User who shares info and request something, and the User who meets the requirements of the first user.
The first user group must be family member or friend of the Sad person. The idea is to make a Surprise to the Sad person.
The second user group can be anyone who can donate and promise whatever the request is.
After the Second user do the job, The first user must argument the surprise moment and to publish it. 
Published works must be emotional, warm and make the Second user happy and proud. 
I think that the application has to be webApp. I have no experience on mobile apps nor desktop apps.
The name of the app must change I just can't come with a perfect name at this time.
Also this is my first experience here on GitHub, so sorry for my mistakes, also I'm not good at grammar English you might see mistakes probably.
I would love so much to see some helpful Feedbacks.
